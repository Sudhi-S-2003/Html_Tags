        <p>An FAQ accordion is a design pattern commonly used on websites to present Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in a user-friendly manner. The accordion layout allows for questions to be collapsed or expanded individually, which helps in organizing the content efficiently and keeping the webpage clean and navigable.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Question Headers</strong>: These are clickable elements that represent the individual questions.</li>
                <li><strong>Answer Panels</strong>: These are hidden sections that contain the answers and are revealed when the corresponding question header is clicked.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Toggle Visibility</strong>: Clicking on a question header expands the answer panel to show the content. Clicking it again collapses the panel.</li>
                <li><strong>Smooth Transition</strong>: Typically, the opening and closing of the panels involve a smooth sliding animation.</li>
                <li><strong>Single/Multiple Open Panels</strong>: Some implementations allow multiple panels to be open simultaneously, while others ensure that only one panel can be open at a time.</li>
            </ul>
